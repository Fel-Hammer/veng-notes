Vengeance Notes is a collection of notes and bits of information that I find interesting or important about
Vengeance Demon Hunter. Things end up in here so that I don't have to search Discord in order to find where I
wrote them down originally.

Most of the things in here are from extensive testing and research and I try my best to keep it up-to-date.

There will be no PvP related information in any of these notes as I don't PvP.

<Aside type="caution">
  Vengeance Notes is not intended to be a guide to Vengeance Demon Hunter, nor will it ever be.
